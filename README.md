# Mac Setup
Notes on how I set up my Macbook

## What is this?
I got a new Macbook Pro when I joined Housing.com, and I have been trying to tune it to my liking. I have terrible memory, and will struggle a lot if I ever have to go through this again. This repo is an attempt to document every important change I make, to help the future me. Hopefully, it's not too late already.

## I saw something cool, can I copy it?
Yep. This repo is MIT licensed, so do whatever you please. I try to attribute my sources, and would be glad if you do the same.

## I have some suggestions, can I chime in?
Absolutely! Please file an issue on this repo.
