# Annoyances with MAC
Using a Macbook is not without its downsides. I have been a happy Ubuntu user
for long, and moving to OSX is a little painful.

1. The Keyboard: It is great for general use, until you miss <kbd>Home</kbd>,
<kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>PageUp</kbd>, <kbd>PageDown</kbd>, separate keys for
<kbd>Backspace</kbd> and <kbd>Delete</kbd>, etc. The <kbd>fn</kbd> and
<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> shortcuts don't work reliably. I miss <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> too,
but can live with the alternate and weird shortcuts.

2. The window management: This one is fucked up. What do you mean, I can't
tile my windows? I have to live with this window manager, there is not even a
choice? Great! I miss my heavily customized Unity. Thankfully, hotcorners,
Spectacle.app and some adjustments to my workflows helped me cope with this.
I still miss my 3x3 workspace grid in Unity, though. Just a series of spaces is
not as great.

3. Finder is stupid. No shortcut to toggle display of hidden files? This is
insane. There's some paid app that does this. More on paid apps later. After
being accustomed to managers like Dolphin and Nautilus, Finder doesn't exactly
make you jump with joy. But well, gotta live with it.

4. File systems: Case-insensitive file system? I can not use this one. Nope,
can't choose an alternate filesystem for root, gotta live with this. Can I move
my projects and stuff to something more sensible, like ext4, or better, btrfs?
Nah. Not supported. Any filesystem other than HFS+ or FAT is a pain to work
with. I have an external HD, nicely partitioned, with most of it having ext4 on
LVM and a tiny NTFS partition for people around me who were stuck with windows.
I can't access this HD at all. I *need* sensible LVM management, but no luck.
Unsupported. At this point I'm weeping, because transferring my data is going
to be a nightmare. Also, bonus: Did I tell you I *love* `__MACOSX` and 
`.DS_Store` littered everywhere?

5. I manage all my passwords with KeepassX. It has a great feature, you can
bind a hotkey to detect currently open webpage or application, fetch the
credentials, and autotype keystrokes required to fill the details properly.
This is one of those things I always show off. Guess what? Linux only. Anything
that can act as a sensible replacement? Nada.

6. Package manager: Or the lack thereof. There is homebrew, but it feels dirty.
What sensible modern OS does not have package manager bundled? Even windows is
getting one, c'mon. Also, related: Drag this from here to there to install.
Well, guess what? Screw you. Cask relieves the pain a little, though.

7. App Store: Sloooooooooow. I can almost take a nap when it changes from one
screen to another, and I'm on a decent interenet connection. Also, I couldn't
even download a couple of free apps that I badly needed, because I couldn't
log in because I don't have a credit card. Luckily was able to log in finally
without adding payment options, after lot of struggle. I don't mind paying for
good software, but even simple stuff is paid in this ecosystem. It is
a little unsettling for someone who is used to the linux world.

8. The command line: I know what you are thinking. There can't be complaints
here, this is UNIX. Well, I'm used to GNU utilities. They happily accept
options after args. Did a quick `ls <some-path>` and need to checkout hidden
files too? `ls <some-path> -al` doesn't work. Add options before args. Arrrrgh.
The filesystem conventions are not strictly followed, apps are packaged in
their folders, this is like being back to windows!

9. Flash: No, not joking. Though officially Linux has no flash support, I had
much much better experience with websites using flash on my linux box. I know,
flash is stupid and ugly, but sometimes it is needed. On OSX, it feels
primitive, like when I used to use windows, some 6 years ago.

10. And the innumerable Linux tools, some of which have no replacements.

My roommate (when we were staying in hotel initially) told me the story of
Procrustes. A greek story where this guy would kidnap travellers, treat them to
a royal feast, and when it is time for bed, used to stretch the guest if they
are shorter than the bed, and chop the limbs if they are longer, to exactly fit
the size of his bed. Using OSX feels very much like being treated by Procrustes.
It feels great for simple everyday stuff for most users, but if you don't fit
it, you are screwed. For me, a computer should do as I please, not the other
way around.

But I love the mac for its hardware. The battery life is unparalled, and the
performance it delivers, packed compactly. I am a fan of Apple hardware. And
I can live without their software.
